Young graduate, people changing career or just seeking a new job, everyone know how tedious it can be to send speculative applications...
It takes a lot of time to find companies that can fit to your professional professional expectations...

And even if you're lucky enough to find some, you must :
* Look for its email adress (In case there's not a section for applicant)
* Write and send a email with an attachment such as your resume or cover letter

Of course, it's not impossible...but it is really timeconsuming ! 
Let's say, you spend at least 3 minutes for each application once you've already made your resume and cover letter's templates.
If you wish to apply to 100 companies, it will take at 300 minutes, which means at least 5 hours...I think you get the idea.

Here is why Job_application_via_webscraping can be helpful for you !
